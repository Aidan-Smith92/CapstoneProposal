  "Approach": "\n            I plan on approaching this capstone through several steps.   \n\n            -Create a single dataset\n            -Make training set\n            -Train algorithm using training set\n            -Test accuracy of algorithm\n            -Try to improve accuracy\n            ",
  "Timeline": "\n            This a rough time line for this project:  \n\n            - (2 Weeks) Creating a single dataset\n            - (2 Weeks) Make training set\n            - (3 Weeks) Train algorithm\n            - (2 Weeks) Test accuracy of algorithm\n            - (3 Weeks) Try to improve accuracy of algorithm\n            ",
  "Expected Number Students": "\n            For this project maximum 4 students can work on it.  \n            ",
  "Possible Issues": "\n            The challenge is improving the accuracy of the algorithm.\n            ",
